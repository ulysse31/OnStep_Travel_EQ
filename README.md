It is composed of tree 3d printed parts : top, middle and bottom block.

# What you need (Part list):
My travel EQ mount is composed of:
- 2x NEMA17 motors (mine 400 steps, 47mm long nema17)
- 2x 100:1 gearbox (I used a OKD42 100:1 precision gearbox)
- 2x 80T GT2 pulley
- 2x 20T GT2 pulley
- 2x 184T GT2 belt
- 2x KFL08 bearings
- 2x M8 steel tube (for now)
- M5 threaded rods (cut to length)
- M4 threaded rods (cut to length)
- 16x M5 locking nuts
- 8x M4 locking nuts
- 2x M5 to M8 shaft couplers (for now)
- 2x M5 to 1/4" adapter (for now)
- 2x RJ45 ports
- 2x piece of copper PCB for etching the little boards for the RJ45 ports connectors.

You can use other parts, but you'll have to modify the SCAD and regenerate the STLs.
On the elements marked "for now", this is because it is a beta version, I want to improve it and change those elements in the future.
